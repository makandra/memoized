### Compatible changes

Forked [memoizer](https://github.com/wegowise/memoizer) with two changes:

1. Memoized methods now preserve their [arity](https://apidock.com/ruby/Method/arity). Previously all memoized methods had an arity of `-1`.
2. Memoized methods are now faster at runtime. This will only be noticable if you call a memoized methods many times in the same request.

We published our fork as a new gem named [memoized](https://rubygems.org/gems/memoized).

memoized is API-compatible to memoizer, you just need to `include Memoized` instead of `Memoizer`:

```ruby
class A
  include Memoized

  memoize def hello
    'hello!'
  end
end
```
